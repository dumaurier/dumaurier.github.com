I'm testing to see how Prose.io is for editing a Jekyll blog. This will be the least compelling blog post in history.

I really like Jekyll but I'm still not used to writing in Markdown. My instinct is to continue writing in plain old HTML even though I know it's ineffectiant for writing.

So I'm just going to write some nonsense to try to get used to it.

Maybe I'll just use it as an excuse to output some generic elements and see what's missing from the CSS framework...such as it is.

### An Ordered List

1. This is an item
    2. So is this
    3. And this
2. This is another item
3. As is this
4. Continuing with more items

### An Unordered List

- This is an item
    - So is this
    - And this
- This is another item
- As is this
- Continuing with more items

### A Paragraph with some text-level semantics

This is the beginning of the paragraph. And suddenly, I'm going to get **emphatic**. How does that feel? ~~It feels great!~~. That was fun. _REALLY FUN_. I still get can't behind links though. So let's try one.
Here's a link to [Workopolis](https://workopolis.com) which is where I'm employed.

> I'm starting to like this Markdown thing. It's not nearly as bad as I thought it would be.

So block quotes work pretty well but what about inline quotes? "This doesn't feel right", he said. Nope, just uses normal quotations but doesn't use the &lt;q> element. But Markdown and normal HTML play nicely together _or so they say_.

### Just How Well Do Markdown and HTML Work Together?

I'm going to find out by throwing a &lt;details> element in here. Fun.

<details>
<summary>This is the summary</summary>
And here are some details. _With_ Markdown included
</details>
<details>
<summary>Yeah, this version will work</summary>
<p>Because I'm using HTML all the way. <em>SEE!?!?!</em> It works</p>
</details>

## Summary

Markdown is pretty nice. And Prose.io is pretty great if you don't have access to a text editor though working directly in GitHub is fine as well. In conclusion, this a completly uneventful post with a few spelling mistakes that I'm not going to fix.
