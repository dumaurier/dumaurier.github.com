This article references the new [CSS Grid Layout Module](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid/). More specifically, it covers the [grid-template-areas](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid/#grid-template-areas-property) property. It is a powerfuly property that lets you visualize your grid in your CSS and explictly place grid items in a named area.

## Defining a simple grid.

As simple grid layout could be a page with a sidebar and large content container surronded by a header and footer.The basic markup would consist of something like this:

{% highlight html %}
<main class="grid-container">
  <header class="header"></header>
    <nav class="nav"></nav>
    <section class="content"></section>
  <footer class="footer"></footer>
</main>
{% endhighlight %}

The `header` and `footer` will span the full width of the container while the sidebar will take up about a 25% of the container and the content will fill the rest. To express this with `grid-template-areas` I'll need to apply the following CSS the the `grid-container`:

{% highlight css %}
.grid-container{
  display: grid;                      /* 1 */
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr;     /* 2 */
  grid-template-rows: 4rem auto 3rem; /* 3 */
  grid-gap: 20px;                     /* 4 */
  grid-template-areas:                /* 5 */
    " header header "
    " nav content "
    " footer footer "
  ;
}
{% endhighlight %}

1. Set the `display` property to `grid`.
2. Use the `grid-template-columns` property to set the number of coumns and define their width (in this exampe I'm using the new [fr unit](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-css3-values-20110906/#fr-unit) to set the width of the first column to 1/4 of the available width and content section to 3/4 of the available width.
3. The `grid-template-rows` property can be used to define the height of the rows. In this example the `header` and `footer` will take 4rem and 3rem respectivly and the body content will take up the remaining available space.
4. The `grid-gap` property defines the grid's gutters and is shorthand for `grid-column-gap` and `grid-row-gap`.
5. This is the fun part. `grid-template-areas` defines the areas available in the grid. The name given to grid areas are arbitrary but should be sensible. The `grid-template-areas` also provides a crude visual representation of the page layout.

Child elements of a grid are assigned to their location using the `grid-area` property on the child elements. This is a very simple example but it already demonstrates the power the CSS Grid Layout. Simply changing the name a classes `grid-area` can drastically change the layout.

{% highlight css %}
.header{
 grid-area: header;
}

.nav{
  grid-area: nav;
}

.content{
  grid-area: content;
}

.footer{
  grid-area: footer;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Changing the `grid-area` in the CodePen below can really mess with the layout. In a good way.

## Creating a nested grid.

CSS Grid Layout Level 1 was initially meant to include subgrid layout as well but as Rachel Andrew has pointed out, this have been moved to [Level 2 of the CSS Grid specification](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2017/03/16/subgrid-moved-to-level-2-of-the-css-grid-specification/). However, creating a nested grid is a simple as applying `display: grid;` to an element whose parent is a grid container. In this example the simple layout above will have its `content` grid-area contain its own two-column grid.

{% highlight css %}
.content{
  grid-area: content; /* from the previous example */
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; /* two columns of equal width */
  grid-gap: 10px;
}
{% endhighlight %}

The nested grid will now contain a two-column grid of items, each column will take 50% of available space.
